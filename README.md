I updated NNEBF's Spear Pillar Omega Form and included a Battlefield Form and added Legendary Pok√©mon Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Cresselia, Darkrai and Arceus with their own color tints. Dialga, Palkia and Giratina come with their Altered Formes and Origin Formes. Dialga appears with a blue tint, Palkia appears with a pink tint, Giratina appears with a red tint, Cresselia appears with a default green tint, Darkrai appears with a pitch black tint and Arceus appears with a yellow tint.
